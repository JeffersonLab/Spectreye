<h1>Spectreye</h1>
<br>
Spectreye is a tool for automatically determining the angle of the Super High Momentum Spectrometer (SHMS) and the High Momentum Spectrometer (HMS) in JLab's Experimental Hall C. The script in its currnt form uses OpenCV and Pytesseract to extract precise angle readings from images taken by cameras mounted on the spectrometers' Vernier calipers. The script is optimized for the JLab spectrometers, but can most likely be adapted to read images from any Vernier scale as long as the center of the caliper is near the center of the image.
